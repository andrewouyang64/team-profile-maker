# Team Profile Maker

- This is an application run under command line console to generate a nice team profile HTML page after entering the selected members.

- The profile includes team members such as manager, engineer and intern with standard employee details as well as individual special information.

- The inquirer package is implemented to present questions.

- The jest package is used for tests on all units to make sure they pass the test.
